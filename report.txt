Goal -
1. Use block editor (Gutenberg) instead of/ along with shortcode
2. Add a block with options for the user to choose which user meta data will be displayed

Work done -
1. Checked all links sent
2. Logged into WordPress account and explored the test page
3. Forked and cloned the git repository
4. Looked into shortcodes and block editor
5. Looking into writing WordPress plugins and shortcodes to better understand the user_meta_shortcode file as well as how to edit it to get desired results.
6. Installed WordPress locally in my system so I can see the effects of the changes made in the plugin file without affecting the original WordPress site.

Issues -
1. Cannot open DB GUI and SFTP
   But I decided to look into it later and focus more on what is working right now - the WordPress site and plugin code.

Queries/Requests

It will take me a while to get used to shortcode and WordPress plugins. I will get to editing/writing new code as soon as I get the hang of WordPress first. It might take a couple of days, so I hope it is not a problem.

Time spent today (IST) - 1:30 pm - 8 pm (half an hour coffee break)
